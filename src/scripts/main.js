// A local nightclub is having a Battle of the Bands night in a few months. They expect many bands to sign up 
// because the grand prize is $20,000. To make things easier on the nightclub management, they want each band to 
// be assigned a number so that they can easily keep track of the order in which the bands will perform.

// Your job is to write a function that accepts any band name as an argument. The function will increment a 
// global variable by one each time it is invoked, and return that number, and the band name concatenated together.

let bandNumber = 1;

const takeNumber = function (bandName) {
let bandListItem = `${bandNumber}. ${bandName}`
    bandNumber++
   return bandListItem
};

const scum = takeNumber("Galactic Scum")
console.log(scum)  // This should print "1. Galactic Scum" in the console

const under = takeNumber("Underdogs")
console.log(under)  // This should print "2. Underdogs" in the console
